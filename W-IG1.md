Reading data from an external source, such as a spreadsheet or database, how can you design info-graphics to make that information accessable? The workshop addresses the whole path: from sketching the basic layout, analysing the data, making the design parametric and coding the design into a working tool.

#### Example exercises

* Write code that generates a calendar;
* Design the layout and write code that generate various types of graphs from a given dataset;
* Use icons, type or illustrations to visualize data;
* Research the design and coding of maps and platform for info-graphics.
