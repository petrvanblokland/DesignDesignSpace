<h2>Virtual studies and teaching online</h2>
<p>With a total of 60+ years of educating design, both in physical space, as well as in virtual environments, we can offer the experience itself as a topic of a study. How to design the way that you teach? How to develop methods for feedback? What works in an online environment and what doesn’t? How to build layers in assignments, where student think they learn one thing, while in reality they learn a lot more as well? What is the goal of a study? And what is realistic to expect?</p>

<h2>Virtual sabbatical</h2>
<p>You have been working as a designer for some years, employed by a studio or running your own. You have been really successful or a bit less, in any case, there is a moment in time to answer the question “What’s next?”. </p>
<p>At the same time, you don’t think you have the age or freedom or financial resources to take a real sabbatical break and do a Master study abroad for 2 years. DesignDesign.Space offers the opportunity of doing a virtual sabbatical: studying new topics or deepen the ones that you already know in a challenging online environment, together with other students, who are seeking similar extensions to their professional career. How this is organized, depends on your needs and resources. </p>
