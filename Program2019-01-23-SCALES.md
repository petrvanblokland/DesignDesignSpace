Example study

## Choosing colors

How to design a coherent set of colors for a defined purpose, by managing the similarities and differences between colors? Which models to use? And what is the best process for the available time? 

The study *Choosing colors* learns students to design color palettes, in paint and digital tools. And the crossings between those media.

## Study Thesis^10

## Quoting a project^20

Making a quote for any project is fundamentally impossible. Yet, that is what most customers require for designers to get the assignment. 

The solution to the problem is to run the entire project in simulation mode. In your head and on paper, Alone and with others. Based on experience of similar projects and activities. What needs to be done in what order? How do you estimate the time that others will be spending on the projects? The answer: talk to them.

<a name="S20a"/>
### Describe an imaginary design project^20a

Break the project down into parts and estimate them separately. Remember that designers always guess too optimistic. Reality is that everything designers do, takes more time than planned. On the other hand, if you would count all the time that they **want**, you’ll never get to a competing quote. Where is the realistic balance?

Then assemble the parts back into a total estimate for the projects, still showing hours and costs for the individual parts. Try to find out how close or far-off that total is from projects by other designers. And verify with your customer, if that amount is according to the budget.

Iterate if the amount is too different. Yes: Making a competing project estimate and planning is a design process in itself. **3 hours**

## Paint a 3-step gray scale^105
Paint (using guache) a 3-step gray scale (white, middle, black) in three connected rectangles of 60x30mm each. The gray should appear to balance between the white and black. Make multiple iterations, pick the best. Show others and ask if they see visual breaks. **2 hours**
