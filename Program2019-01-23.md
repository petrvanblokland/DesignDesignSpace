### Example studies

## Develop your process. Expand your skills.

One of the important tasks in any design process is to create structure from chaos. Grouping objects by similar characteristics or behavior. Sorting by height? Or is it better to create order by color?

<!--
The study *Making structure from chaos* learns students to design parameters – like size, color, position, texture, value – weigh their values to fit the needs. In a sketch process and as final presentation. Following individual style preferences while matching with requirements of the user.

~~~
## It all happens in DesignDesign.Space studies

If you tell us what you want to study in a first free online hangout, we make suggestions. What would you like to achieve? Improve your latent coding skills, while training your self-discipline? Seeking a sparring partner for an interesting new design project? Updating your technical skills? Or do you simply need a refreshing break from design practice? 

---
## DesignDesign.Space as coach

**DesignDesign.Space** can help you to answer these questions and to achieve your goals. Coaching you through your study, the teachers can ask the toughest questions. And they also are available to help you answering them: If you are happy with the design you have finally finished, what exactly are you happy with? How does that fit the expectations of the user? And how would you get there next time?

[See more about pricing here.](pricing.html)

box = page.select('Side00')
~~~
## How studies work

* During a first free hangout, we can talk about possible goals.
* Together, we will find a way for you to get there. Topics & Tools. By painting, drawing, sketching or by coding. Or by using all.
* In sequences of relative short assignments, online hangouts, feedback and reflections, we explore the paths through your study project. And more important, we’ll teach you how to do that yourself.
* The journey can take a day. Or a week. A month. A year. Whichever fits your goals, time and resources. And, of course, the level of details that you need. 
* If your plans change along the way, that can always be discussed.

## Challenge us

We are educators and we are designers too. That means we are open for suggestions about our teaching and the program. For us, teaching is as much of a challenge as any design process. Send us your questions on topics that we never thought about before. How can this website be improved? Lure us into teaching you in a different way than this website suggests. We will probably take the challenge.

# Studies in 2019

We keep improving the curriculum. The mandatory design of design education. Instead of the fixed [2018](2018-program.html) list of workshops, studies and dates, in practice, we found out that it is better to make the schedule entirely flexible. Hints of topics, templates of studies and suggestions for the process behind.

## Pricing

Each lesson is an online hangout, lasting for part of the day – morning or afternoon – depending on your timezone. The pricing is based on the length and intensity of a study. 

If a study is spread over a longer period time, intensity can be lower for the same price. However, it requires more self-discipline for a student to take full advantage of the study and the support we can offer.

## Design of design models

Develop and select design methods. What is available beyond “scrum”? Which methods can you design for yourself, by scaling and managing details? Sketching and making of small scale models is such a technique: get an impression about your design choices at an early stage, without making the “real thing”.

* A week of 3 lessons (1+ hour each), **$490** per student
* Daily feedback by e-mail on results for the duration of the study
* Document sharing and versioning through GitHub

## Rapid prototyping for graphic designers

Learn to develop efficient and powerful prototyping techniques including manual sketching, digital tools and coding, with the goal of controlling the broadening and narrowing of options and directions a project may take.
Through sketching, hands-on practical exercises and presentations, you explore the process of making prototypes.
This study is a follow up on the **Design of design models**, but can be also joined separately.

## Live coaching while starting your studio

You are working on starting your own studio. You just graduated or you have been working in a design studio for years and now it is time to start your own. It seems to be a promising, interesting and rewarding plan. But it is also hard to control planning, budget and clients fantasies. Especially if projects run over a longer period of time.
How coaching is organized, depends on your needs. It varies from a single lesson of support, while writing an initial quote, up to helping you with management and feedback of your entire project.

* A week of 3 lessons (1+ hour each), **$490** per student

## Virtual sabbatical

You have been working as a designer for some years, employed by a studio or running your own. You have been really successful or a bit less, in any case, there is a moment in time to answer the question “What’s next?”. 

At the same time, you don’t think you have the age or freedom or financial resources to take a real sabbatical break and do a Master study abroad for 2 years. DesignDesign.Space offers the opportunity of doing a virtual sabbatical: studying new topics or deepen the ones that you already know in a challenging online environment, together with other students, who are seeking similar extensions to their professional career. How this is organized, depends on your needs and resources. 

* Initial online hangout, free of charge.
* A single lesson for a day: **$190** per student
* A week of 3 lessons (1+ hour each), **$490** per student
* A month or more of 8 lessons (2+ hours each), **$1.900** per student
* A season **$3.900**
* A year **Ask**
* Document sharing and versioning through GitHub

# What students wrote

![DDS-Drawing-June-Shin w=perc(50)](images/DDS-drawing-June-Shin.png)

*“This was a unique opportunity in that it wasn’t just a programming class, but one that was specifically catered to type designers to meet their needs. I didn’t know any Python whatsoever prior to this course, so in the beginning, it felt like being thrown into the sea without a life jacket. Petr is not a lifeguard; he is a swimming coach. He won’t rescue you — that’s too easy — but he will throw you a rope. (In fact, many ropes. You ask one question and he gives you five answers.) I appreciated that everyone was able to swim at their own pace. An experienced designer and astonishingly deep thinker, Petr offers far more than just coding knowledge. It was a privilege to be able to learn from him.*
*Again, thank you so much! I learned a ton these four weeks and I'm so grateful.”* **– June Shin**

---

*“The one month course is designed to accommodate type designers with various levels of Python and programming knowledge. The learning environment is set up similarly to a master's class which allows Petr to focus on individual needs. In addition, the course allows students to take their studies towards their personal needs and interests. The class is not just a skill learning environment as a good portion of the time is dedicated to critical discussions, such as designing one's design process or the ways new technologies and developments will effect and change how we design and think about type.”* **– Cem Eskinazi**

---

*“For me, the Python scripting for type designers course from Design Design Space was a perfect complement to my formation as a typeface designer. It was a unique opportunity to learn type-related Python in first hand from a competent instructor. Petr doesn’t leave questions open, and the course’s pace flows according to each student’s needs.”* **– Filipe Negrão**

---

*“This is my first time to have a formal Latin Design class. I am very lucky that I can learn from Petr because there is few Latin design classes in Taiwan.* 

*Petr always is teaching design knowledge enthusiastically, using all he knows, when you have questions. Petr not only taught us how to design Latin fonts, but also how to think about the effect of every design and how to adjust them to become a better one. The most important thing is that you don't have to be afraid, if you are a starter because Petr will give a tailored class for everyone. I can promise that you can get a lot of treasures from Petr. I appreciate a lot that I could gain this experience from DDS.”* **- Tom Kuo**

## Pricing

Each lesson is an online hangout, lasting for part of the day – morning or afternoon – depending on your timezone. The total price is based on the length and intensity of a study. 

If a study is spread over a longer period of time, intensity can be lower for the same price. However, it requires more self-discipline for a student to take full advantage of the study and the support we can offer.

The prices of the studies are indicators, dependant on length and intensity. A specific topic can be addressed in a couple of days. Or it can be the subject of a thourough study, lasting for a month or longer. 

Lessons can extend in time, if multiple students attend at the same time.

* Initial online hangout, free of charge.
* A single lesson for a whole day: **$190** per student
* A week of 3 lessons (1+ hour each): **$490** per student
* A month or more of 8 lessons (2+ hours each): **$1.900** per student
* A season: **$3.900**
* A year: **Ask**

### Furthermore, for all studies and workshops:

* Daily feedback by e-mail on results for the duration of the study
* Document sharing and versioning through GitHub

Example study

## Choosing colors

How to design a coherent set of colors for a defined purpose, by managing the similarities and differences between colors? Which models to use? And what is the best process for the available time? 

The study *Choosing colors* learns students to design color palettes, in paint and digital tools. And the crossings between those media.
