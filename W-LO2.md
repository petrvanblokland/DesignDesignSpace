In modern media, logos no longer need to be static. But in traditional logo design that often is the starting points. This workshop emphasizes on designing or extracting parameters to make a given logo vary in time (e.g. making an animation) or to vary the shape depending on circumstances. Examining the different parameters in an existing logo, also is a good trsource for creating Variable Fonts.


#### Example exercises

* Select an existing logo (or take one that you designed yourself). What other varations can be made and which parameters do the morphing?
* Make an inventory of the parameters given by different media: what is possible in an interactive platform? What are the limitations and challenges for print? 
* Write code that export the various of the logo as specimen pages in PDF and animations as GIF.
