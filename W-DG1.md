The Design Game has 5 rounds, starting at a specific time on December 29th 2020. Each round has a different design assignment, ranging from respectively the design of a logo, a typographic page, a poster, a (corporate) identity and finally an exhibition.

There is a strict and limited time frame available for each round, ranging from 1 hour at the start to 3 hours in the finale. Details about each assignment are given just before each round starts.

So, by definition, the finalists will show their skills as if in a sport “Pentathlon” match, expecting assignments for which it is unlikely that they specialized in all. Challenge your luck and speed.

After each round, the results are presented on Instagram, where the number of likes and the judgment of a professional jury will decide who passes to the next round.

The game needs at least 16 participants to take place, with a maximum of 32.
