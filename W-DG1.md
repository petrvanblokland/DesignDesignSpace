A typographic “Pentathlon” from 27-31 October.

The Design Game has 5 rounds, starting at a specific time on December 29<span class="sup">th</span>.
Each round has a different design assignment, ranging from respectively the design of a logo, a typographic page, a poster, a (corporate) identity and finally an exhibition. 

There is a strict and limited time frame available for each round, ranging from 1 hour at the start to 3 hours in the finale. Details about each assignment are given just before a round starts.

So, by definition, the finalists will show their skills as if in a sport “Pentathlon” match, expecting assignments for the design of a logo, a poster, a publication, a corporate identity and an exhibition. Challenge your luck and speed.

After each round, the results are presented on Instagram, where the number of likes and the judgment of a professional jury will decide who passes to the next round on the next day. 

The game needs at least 20 participants to take place, with a maximum of 50.
