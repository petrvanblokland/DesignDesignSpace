<h2>Pricing</h2>
<p>Each lesson is an online hangout, lasting for part of the day, morning or afternoon, depending on your timezone. The total price is based on the length and intensity of your study. </p>
<p>If a study is spread over a longer period of time, intensity can be lower for the same price. However, it requires more self-discipline for a student to take full advantage of the study and the support that we can offer.</p>
<p>The prices of the studies are indicators: a specific topic can be addressed in a couple of days. Or it can be the subject of a thorough study, taking a month or longer to complete.</p>
<p>Lessons can be extended in time, if multiple students attend at the same workshop or study.</p>
