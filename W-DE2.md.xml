<p>The world has suddenly changed. Teaching in class rooms is no longer possible. As experienced as you are, educating designers, the new skills are required for online teaching. </p>
<p>This workshop shares our experience of teaching online with DesignDesign.Space workshops for 4 years now. And also, we love to show how we organized the latest TypeLab.</p>
<h4>Example exercises</h4>
<ul>
<li>Learn the basics about game theory;</li>
<li>Exercises the design of simulations that help in the design process of students;</li>
<li>Make templates that can be applied in design education.</li>
</ul>
<p>This workshop is following up on <a href="#DE1">Teaching Design: online exercises, feedback &amp; evaluation</a>.</p>
