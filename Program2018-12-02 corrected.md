# What is your design space?

Tell us want you want to study. What do you want to achieve? Improve your latent coding skills, while training your self-discipline? Seeking a sparring partner for an interesting new design project? Updating your technical skills? Or you simply need a refreshing break from a design practice that became too predictable? 

**DesignDesign.Space** can help with that aim. Coaching you through your study, at some moments the teachers can ask the toughest questions. If you are happy with the design you have finally finished, what exactly is it that you are happy with?

What topic would you like to study? And what is your goal at the end? Even finding answers to those questions, could be a design process itself. How to start? How to continue? And most important: how to finish successfully within a given amount of time? 

## How DDS-studies work

* During your first free hangout, you describe what you want to achieve.
* Together, we will find a way for you doing that. Topics. Teachers. Targets.
* In sequences of relative short assignments, online hangouts, feedback and reflections, we guide you through your study project. And more important, we’ll teach you how to do that yourself.
* It can be a day. Or a week. A month. Or a year. Whichever fits your goals, time and resources. And if your ideas change along the way, that can always be discussed.

## Challenge us

We are educators and designers. For us, teaching is as much of a challenge as any design process is. Send us  your questions on topics that we never thought about before. Lure us into teaching you in a different way than this entire website suggests. We probably will take the challenge.

# Program 2019

We keep improving the curriculum. The mandatory design of design education. Instead of the fixed [2018](program-2018.html) list of workshops, studies and dates, in practice we found it better to make the schedule entirely flexible. Hints of topics, templates of studies and suggestions for the process behind.

Each lesson is an online hangout, lasting for part of the day – morning or afternoon – depending on your timezone. The pricing below is for one student. 

If a study is spread over a longer period time, intensity can be lower for the same price. However, it requires more self-discipline for a student to take full advantage of the study and the support we can offer.

### Pricing

The prices of the studies are indicators, related to length and intensity. A specific topic can be addressed in a couple of days. Or it can be the subject of thourough study, lasting for a month or longer. 

A lesson can extend in time, if multiple students attend at the same time.

* Initial online hangout, free of charge.
* Single lesson, **$190** per student
* A week of 3 lessons (1+ hour each), **$490** per student
* A month or more of 8 lessons (2+ hours each), **$1.900** per student
* A season **$3.900**
* A year **$7.900**


### Ask for info

Let us know at [info@designdesign.space](mailto:info@designdesign.space?subject=Tell%20me%20more%20about%20DesignDesign.Space) if there is something you are interested in from the program below. Or tell us if you have other wishes that are related to design. 

*Don't hesitate to contact us if the indicated price is the only problem for you that would prevent you from studying.*

## Virtual sabbatical

You have been working as a designer for some years, employed by a studio or running your own. You have been really successful or a bit less, in any case, there is a moment in time to answer the question “What’s next?”. 

At the same time, you don’t think you have the age or freedom or financial resources to take a real sabbatical break and do a Master study abroad for 2 years. DesignDesign.Space offers the opportunity of doing a virtual sabbatical: studying new topics or deepen the ones that you already know in a challenging online environment, together with other students, who are seeking similar extensions to their professional career. How this is organized, depends on your needs and resources.

## Testimonials

*“This was a unique opportunity in that it wasn’t just a programming class, but one that was specifically catered to type designers to meet their needs. I didn’t know any Python whatsoever prior to this course, so in the beginning, it felt like being thrown into the sea without a life jacket. Petr is not a lifeguard; he is a swimming coach. He won’t rescue you — that’s too easy — but he will throw you a rope. (In fact, many ropes. You ask one question and he gives you five answers.) I appreciated that everyone was able to swim at their own pace. An experienced designer and astonishingly deep thinker, Petr offers far more than just coding knowledge. It was a privilege to be able to learn from him.*
*Again, thank you so much! I learned a ton these four weeks and I'm so grateful.”* **– June Shin**

---

*“The one month course is designed to accommodate type designers with various levels of Python and programming knowledge. The learning environment is set up similarly to a master's class which allows Petr to focus on individual needs. In addition, the course allows students to take their studies towards their personal needs and interests. The class is not just a skill learning environment as a good portion of the time is dedicated for critical discussions such as designing one's design process or the ways new technologies and developments will effect and change how we design and think about type.”* **– Cem Eskinazi**

---

*“For me, the Python scripting for type designers course from Design Design Space was a perfect complement to my formation as a typeface designer. It was a unique opportunity to learn type-related Python in first hand from a competent instructor. Petr doesn’t leave questions open, and the course’s pace flows according to each student’s needs.”* **– Filipe Negrão**

## A 5-day workshop about Graphic Design^780

The workshop addresses the profession of Graphic Design. What skills and knowledge should students get to be a designer for the rest of their professional lives? 

How would you design such a workshop for yourself? How would you train that design skill?

DesignDesign.Space can coach you in that process. [More...](scales-more-780.html)

# DesignDesign.Scales

The DesignDesign.Space started a new initiative. Under the name DesignDesign.Scales, a growing series of small design assignments is available, together with hints about their process and criteria. 

Some will be published as a single Tweet or an Instagram post, referring to the page with additional background information.

Scales are like exercises in music. You can’t play enough of them. Yet, a symphony needs more than just scales. Searching is learning. Playing is exploring.

If you don't manage to finalize an assignment in a recommended amount of time, that is not a problem. Designing the process and planning is an integral part of the design process itself. 

Maybe next time you can select the level of details better. Or pick a different tool. Or another “quality level” for your sketches.

Each assignment has its own number. You can get an impression about their topics by their range of 100. Within that range, simple assignments have low numbers. Higher numbers indicate higher complexity. 

Note that most assignments in a topic relate to other topics as well.

Some assignments are grouped as a sequence. Their number is followed by a letter.

# Type & typography^1000

## Optical circle size^1002 
Draw a filled black square on white background of 6x6 centimeter. Draw a filled circle and triangle (flat side below) on the same baseline, that appear to have the same size as the circle. **1 hour**

### Optical circle sizes^1002a

Start with Scale^1002. Validate the result with a group who did the same, viewing them from a distance. Reject the circles and triangles that are unanimous too small or too large. Measure the remains and conclude the range of optical sizes. **1 hour**

### Optical size for outlines^1002b

Start with Scale^1002 and Scale^1002a, but now all shapes are drawn as black outline of 5mm, white inside. Is their optical size still the same? Discuss and explain the result with the group. **1 hour**
