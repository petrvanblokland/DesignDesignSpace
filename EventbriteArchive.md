#TY5

Many design projects take forever, especially when designing type. And since these project are often based on your individual ideas, it can be hard to get other people involved along the way. Did you make the right decisions at the start? How can you create an environment where feedback is valuable, and not just critique?
This workshop shows methods to share your views with colleagues, without loosing the control of your project.
Select one of your type designs that is being developed. Or take one of your favourite existing typefaces.
We ask questions, you do the work, getting valuable feedback and directions.
Develop some proofing tools, using Python and DrawBot.
Addressing topics, such as process, methods, variable design spaces, features and tools.
Getting ideas how to automate time-consuming parts of your project.
This workshop is a companion of Sketching, feedback and planning in type design.
The workshop assumes no experience with programming in Python. An Apple computer is required to run the DrawBot application.
