Making Variable Fonts beyond the standard **width** and **weight** axis can easily become a project of exponential complexity. What is the best approach to solve that problem? Which techniques can be used to keep the amount of work within realistic proportions?

This workshop shows methods to visualize the complexity, including strategies for sketching and design.

* Sketching various forms of design spaces;
* Adapt your design process to what is needed for Variable Fonts;
* Develop design strategies, using regular type design tools;
