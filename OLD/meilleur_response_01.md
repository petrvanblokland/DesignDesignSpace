Petr: 

I’m glad to see you developing these ideas. You know I share a  lot of your concerns about design education—and I haven’t been doing it nearly as long as you have! And while I think it’s better to have people in the same physical spaces learning from each other, the reality is that we need virtual spaces and can learn in them also.

The most significant thing to me about this project is your approach: your understanding of the design process, its significance and its recursiveness, distinguishing it from production in a way that most design tools today encourage us not to do. On that last point in fact there’s an analogy between DesignDesign and RoboFont/PageBot. With RF/PB, you’re trying to get past a set of conventions and institutionalized assumptions about what design is (what design is *supposed* to be), and what designers do/how they work (how they are *supposed* to work), with tools that require/allow designers to choose and articulate their process, and how they chose that process, and how they chose how they were going to choose that process … tools that used well can allow them to spend more time doing actual design and reflection on their design, and less time with the mechanical/production side of design.

I see DesignDesign as born of the same logic, in the way you extended it in the presentations you’ve been giving: there are aspects of design that are changing rapidly (and increasingly so), and many of them have to do with tech (and fashion, and the economy, too). Approaching design only on the terms laid down by the tech means designers spend an inordinate amount of time learning and keeping up with the tech. And because a good deal of the tech is oriented towards production and builds into itself lots of conventions and assumptions about design, you wind up creating designers who learn to reproduce the status quo and don’t spend enough time actually designing and thinking about design. And in the not too distant future a good deal of the daily work of design will be done by clients themselves with templates that are getting better and better at what clients want done every year … so why not a forum for designers to develop the skills and habits that are about the things that can’t be automated: judgment, research, discovery, play, presentation?

So, to treat what you sent me as a prospectus: I’d lead with the approach and philosophy behind the project, and make the parallels with RoboFont/PageBot clear. I think that gets your potential audience in the right mindset: you are offering them an environment in which they can develop their own tools, in this case the process itself. Participation is the point; they’re not signing up to be handed something if they sit still long enough and take careful notes. And what they do will depend on them and their fellow participants, with the coach’s facilitation.

But to extend the analogy: when you license RoboFont, you’re still licensing *something*. A set of libraries, some prebuilt interfaces, and so on. €400 pays for something ‘tangible’, even if I have to work on my own to use that something to make/do something else. That’s where I could see your audience starting to ask questions: what exactly am I paying $150–$6000 for, even if I have to participate and work to use it? It’s good to establish what you aren’t offering them: a university course, a diploma, training, a set of how-to books or lectures. But they’ll want to know more about what you are offering.

So here is where a set of concrete descriptions of what sessions along these lines in the classes you’ve already conducted using this approach (like at type]media) produced: products, publications, discussions, findings—and also what came of them, what people did with what they learned. I think you start to move in this direction towards the end of this document, but that could be developed more. As could the role of the coach: do you imagine them as experts in the areas of the kinds of projects and processes the participants will be designing and going through? Will the coaches do any instruction, or evaluation, or are they only there to give assignments and facilitate? What are those assignments, exactly? What will that certificate that participants get at the end represent? (Do they even need one?)

I know some of the answers, and you have answers in the document, but I don’t think they’re sufficiently connected yet (I know it’s a rough draft!). The most important thing it seems to me is that the coaches are well-versed in the approach (designing design), and are also designers themselves and know what difference the approach can make. Is that all? Is that enough? Is it worth what you’re asking people to pay? The obvious comparisons people will make, which you acknowledge, to things like massive open online courses and video tutorials like Lynda.com, will be based in part on cost. The nice thing about MOOCs and Lynda are that the organizers can *claim* (however accurately) that ‘at the end of this course’ after paying that cost you’ll know or be able to so some list of concrete things. What you’re up against is how to articulate what you’re offering in a way your audience can understand and compare to the other options.

(Also, how will participants be working with college students? I’m not clear on this exactly, especially since the list of people for whom you think DesignDesign is intended doesn’t include them. Did I overlook something?)

The practical stuff (how to charge, how meetings will work, and so on) I’m going to assume can be dealt with.

So my initial response is positive! And, to suggest you change the order that you discuss topics in the prospectus, so that the readers first know your approach and thus the stakes and benefits of participating in the program, and then see what specifically you are offering them and what kinds of things they should expect to get out of them for the cost of admission.

(By the way, am I understanding correctly that students have to apply and be ‘admitted’ to participate? Or can anyone participate simply for paying the fee?)

I’ve already written a lot and mostly on large-concept stuff, so I should stop here and let you respond. I’m happy to keep talking about this and I have more questions. I hope I’m understanding everything you’re trying to communicate, but if not, let me know.

Looking forward to hearing back from you. mm
