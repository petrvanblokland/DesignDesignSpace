## What is your study?

Our experience and interest with design projects ranges from type design to exhibitions and from writing software to teaching.  

However, most importantly, the question is how that experience can help you to develop your own skills. Let us know what kind of design you would like to study, but never found the right time and space to start.

## Claudia Mens

Claudia Mens (1957) knew young that she wanted to be an interior designer. Yet she chose to study social studies and worked as a study and career counselor. That proved a great orientation to the world and fed her interest in the lives of other people. But it was not fulfilling and led to study the decisive step of Architectural Design at the Royal Academy of Art in The Hague in The Netherland, and then to finish the post-graduate Master Environmental Design. In 2015 she followed a coaching program “Train the Trainer”.

Mens lectured at the Department of Graphic Design (1991-2015) of the Royal Academy of Arts in The Hague. During that period, she also developed a minor program General Design for the University Leiden.

Together with her partner and type designer Petr van Blokland, she started her design studio in 1982. Her special interest is in interior and environmental design, color and materials, the development of workspaces and the coaching of designers.

She was co-founder and head of design for The Health Agency, publisher of online health information, from 2001 to 2006.
