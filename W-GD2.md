This workshop does focus on coding the [Basics of typography, grids and layout](basics-of-typography-grid-and-layout) workshop results. Automate the production of documents for print and convert them into websites. A good understanding of coding in Python is recommended.

#### Example exercises

* Experiment with the Element classes in [PageBot](https://github.com/PageBot/PageBot/blob/master/README.md);
* Convert the results of earliers workshops into working code;
* Design and write the code for new types of page elements, such as the proofing of Variable Fonts and live info-graphics that depend on web-data;
* Generate the functionality of your code as automated generative manuals for print and web.
* Investigate methods to connect this knowledge with your daily design practice.
