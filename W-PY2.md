After finishing [Basic coding in Python #1](#PY1), you have made a program that is doing one specific task. Great as that may be, it is hard to reuse that code for other projects. How nice would it be, to create a **“library”** with knowledge, that can be called for similar designs, without writing everything from scratch again?

The focus of this workshop is in making code more sustainable, using **functions, methods and classes**. Existing Open Source libraries are used, such as **DrawBot** and **PageBotNano**. Exercises take you step by step through the process of coding your graphic design. Instead of manually building a metaforical car, it may be more profitable to build a factory for cars. 

#### Example exercises

* Make a selection of different publications and analyze the variety of (typographic) proportions that they share;
* Sketch the relations between the extracted values and write them as coded rules;
* Store these rules as a library of Python classes;
* Learn to use this library in future design projects.

The use of <a href="http://drawbot.com" target="external">DrawBot</a> in this workshop requires a MacOS computer.

Completion of workshop [Basic coding in Python #1](#TY1) is recommended.
