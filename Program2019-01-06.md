# What would you like to study in 2019?

~~~
box = page.select('Main0')
~~~

Tell us what you want to study. Or allow us make suggestions. What would you like to achieve? Improve your latent coding skills, while training your self-discipline? Seeking a sparring partner for an interesting new design project? Updating your technical skills? Or do you simply need a refreshing break from a design practice that became too predictable to your taste? 

**DesignDesign.Space** can help you to answer these questions and to achieve your goals. Coaching you through your study, at some moments the teachers can ask the toughest questions. If you are happy with the design you have finally finished, what exactly are you happy with?

## What is your design space?

![images/DesignModels2.106.png](images/DesignModels2.106.png)
*[[Making a successful design, it helps thinking backwards. By understanding what it is supposed to do. Not by hoping for the ultimate **lucky shot**.]]*

What topic would you like to study? And what is your goal at the end? Even finding answers to those questions could be a design process itself. How to start? How to continue? And most important: how to finish successfully within the given amount of time? 

~~~
box = page.select('Side00')
~~~

## How studies work

* During a first free hangout, we can talk about possible goals.
* Together, we will find a way for you to get there. Topics & Tools. By painting or by coding. Or by using both.
* In sequences of relative short assignments, online hangouts, feedback and reflections, we explore the paths through your study project. And more important, we’ll teach you how to do that yourself.
* The journey can take a day. Or a week. A month. A year. Whichever fits your goals, time and resources. And, of course, the level of details that you need. 
* If your plans change along the way, that can always be discussed.

## Challenge us

We are educators and designers. That means we are open for suggestions about our teaching and program. For us, teaching is as much of a challenge as any design process. Send us  your questions on topics that we never thought about before. Lure us into teaching you in a different way than this entire website suggests. We will probably take the challenge.

# [Program 2019](program-2019.html)

We keep improving the curriculum. The mandatory design of design education. Instead of the fixed [2018](program-2018.html) list of workshops, studies and dates, in practice, we found it better to make the schedule entirely flexible. Hints of topics, templates of studies and suggestions for the process behind.

Each lesson is an online hangout, lasting for part of the day – morning or afternoon – depending on your timezone. The pricing below is for one student. 

If a study is spread over a longer period time, intensity can be lower for the same price. However, it requires more self-discipline for a student to take full advantage of the study and the support we can offer.

~~~
box = page.select('Side00')
~~~

## Pricing

The prices of the studies are indicators, related to length and intensity. A specific topic can be addressed in a couple of days. Or it can be a subject of thourough study, lasting for a month or longer. 

A lesson can extend in time, if multiple students attend at the same time.

* Initial online hangout, free of charge.
* A single lesson for a day, **$190** per student
* A week of 3 lessons (1+ hour each), **$490** per student
* A month or more of 8 lessons (2+ hours each), **$1.900** per student
* A season **$3.900**
* A year **$7.900**

Furthermore, for all studies and workshops:

* Daily feedback by e-mail on results for the duration of the study
* Document sharing and versioning through GitHub
* Design principles for planning, the process, methods for feedback and testing criteria

You have been working as a designer for some years, employed by a studio or running your own. You have been really successful or a bit less, in any case, there is a moment in time to answer the question “What’s next?”. 

At the same time, you don’t think you have the age or freedom or financial resources to take a real sabbatical break and do a Master study abroad for 2 years. DesignDesign.Space offers the opportunity of doing a virtual sabbatical: studying new topics or deepen the ones that you already know in a challenging online environment, together with other students, who are seeking similar extensions to their professional career. How this is organized, depends on your needs and resources.

## Testimonials

![DDS-Drawing-June-Shin w=perc(50)](images/DDS-drawing-June-Shin.png)

*“This was a unique opportunity in that it wasn’t just a programming class, but one that was specifically catered to type designers to meet their needs. I didn’t know any Python whatsoever prior to this course, so in the beginning, it felt like being thrown into the sea without a life jacket. Petr is not a lifeguard; he is a swimming coach. He won’t rescue you — that’s too easy — but he will throw you a rope. (In fact, many ropes. You ask one question and he gives you five answers.) I appreciated that everyone was able to swim at their own pace. An experienced designer and astonishingly deep thinker, Petr offers far more than just coding knowledge. It was a privilege to be able to learn from him.*
*Again, thank you so much! I learned a ton these four weeks and I'm so grateful.”* **– June Shin**

---

*“The one month course is designed to accommodate type designers with various levels of Python and programming knowledge. The learning environment is set up similarly to a master's class which allows Petr to focus on individual needs. In addition, the course allows students to take their studies towards their personal needs and interests. The class is not just a skill learning environment as a good portion of the time is dedicated to critical discussions, such as designing one's design process or the ways new technologies and developments will effect and change how we design and think about type.”* **– Cem Eskinazi**

---

*“For me, the Python scripting for type designers course from Design Design Space was a perfect complement to my formation as a typeface designer. It was a unique opportunity to learn type-related Python in first hand from a competent instructor. Petr doesn’t leave questions open, and the course’s pace flows according to each student’s needs.”* **– Filipe Negrão**

Many of the DDS-assignments are available online, under the name *DesignDesign.Scales*. Because that is what they are: the scales that musicians play for practice. The name also refers to the scaled models that architects use. 

An increasing amount of assignments in this site will contain “how-to-do-it” information. Try them. If it works for you, that is great. If you need more coaching, then consider a study at DesignDesign.Space, where many more of these exercises are waiting for you.

If you don't manage to finalize an assignment in the recommended amount of time, then that is not a problem. Designing the process and planning the flow are integral parts of the design process itself. 

Maybe next time you can select the level of details better. Or pick a different tool. Or another “quality level” for your sketches.

Each assignment has its own number. You can get an impression about their topics by their range of 100. Within that range, simple assignments have low numbers. Higher numbers indicate higher complexity. 

Some assignments are grouped as a sequence. Their number is followed by a letter.

# Scales: Preparing projects

## Study Thesis^10

Write a 2-page Thesis about your expected study.
Include title, images, summary, literature references and footnotes.
Sketch the layout and content in multiple scales, before anything else. Make many short cycles. Final presentation in **3 hours**

## Quoting a project^20

Making a quote for any project is fundamentally impossible. Yet, that is what most customers require for designers to get the assignment. 

The solution to the problem is to run the entire project in simulation mode. In your head and on paper, Alone and with others. Based on experience of similar projects and activities. What needs to be done in what order? How do you estimate the time that others will be spending on the projects? The answer: talk to them.

Describe an imaginary design project.

Break the project down into parts and estimate them separately. Remember that designers always guess too optimistic. Reality is that everything designers do, takes more time than planned. On the other hand, if you would count all the time that they **want**, you’ll never get to a competing quote. Where is the realistic balance?

Then assemble the parts back into a total estimate for the projects, still showing hours and costs for the individual parts. Try to find out how close or far off that total is from projects that other designers did. And verify with your customer if that amount is also what he is thinking of.

Iterate if too different. Yes: Making a competing project estimate and planning is a design process in itself. **3 hours**
