<p>In modern media, logos no longer need to be static. But in traditional logo design that often is the starting points. This workshop emphasizes on designing or extracting parameters to make a given logo vary in time (e.g. making an animation) or to vary the shape depending on circumstances. Examining the different parameters in an existing logo, also is a good trsource for creating Variable Fonts.</p>
<h4>Example exercises</h4>
<ul>
<li>Select an existing logo (or take one that you designed yourself). What other varations can be made and which parameters do the morphing?</li>
<li>Make an inventory of the parameters given by different media: what is possible in an interactive platform? What are the limitations and challenges for print? </li>
<li>Write code that export the various of the logo as specimen pages in PDF and animations as GIF.</li>
</ul>
<p>The use of <a href="http://drawbot.com" target="external">DrawBot</a> in this workshop requires a MacOS computer.</p>
<p>Completion of workshop <a href="#TY1">Basic coding in Python #1</a> is recommended but not required.</p>
