Learn methods to distinguish between **this one** and **this kind of**. What makes different letters belong to the same typeface? How to make coherent color palettes? How to balance typographic elements on the same page? 

The excercises of this workshop give insight in the various methods to balance visual grammar.

#### Example exercises

* Solve typographic puzzles. Which letters belong to the same typeface and which are too different?
* What is the size of circles to appear having the same size as squares?
* Design a series of different covers. Why do they visually belong to the same group?
* Organize a number of objects in a given space. What are your options to make a composition? How to create a structure?

Completion of workshop [(V1) Visual grammar #1](#visual-grammar1) is recommended.
