## How free workshops work: some rules

#### Subscribing

* Subscribe for **just one** workshop of your choice, by sending an e-mail to [info@designdesign.space](mailto:info@designdesign.space?subject=Subscribing%20for%20the%20free%20DesignDesign.Space%20workshop)
* Describe your daily profession and how that relates to the topic of your selected workshop. Add some samples of your work.
* Workshops are limited to a maximum of 10 students. First come, first served. 
 
#### The workshop

* Using some small assignments, we challenge you to sketch, think, design and give feedback to others.
* Each workshop spans several sessions. There is enough time between them, to give you the opportunity to process the questions of one session into the next one.
* We create an online platform, accessible for all students of the workshop, to share work, questions, comments and documents.
* You are encouraged to join the whole workshop from start to end, following all sessions, not occupying the space for another designer.

#### And after...

* DesignDesign.Space would appreciate to publish some of your work on this website.
* Successfully finishing one of the free workshops gives the right to **20% reduction** on one of the other DesignDesign.Space studies.

## Why we offer this for free

We like to share and express our solidarity with you.

Also, we are educators and we are designers, too. That means, we are curious how others design their design processes. We are open for suggestions about the workshops and about how you perceive the way we teach. For us, educating other designers is as much of a challenge as any design process.

#### New topics
[Send us your request](mailto:info@designdesign.space?subject=Subscribing%20for%20the%20free%20DesignDesign.Space%20workshop) for topics that we never thought about. Or ideas about how the workshops can be improved. Lure us into teaching you in a different way than what we suggest here. Weâ€™ll likely take the challenge.

#### We love your feedback
If you tell us what you want to study by mail or in a first free online hangout, we are happy to make suggestions. What would you like to achieve? Seeking a sparring partner for an interesting new design project? Improving your latent skills, while training your self-discipline? Or simply needing a refreshing break from your normal design practice?
