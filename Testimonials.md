# Python scripting for type designers 2018-03
## June Shin

Hi Petr,

This is the "testimonial" from my presentation (which I put on Github as well):

This was a unique opportunity in that it wasn’t just a programming class but one that was specifically catered to type designers to meet their needs. I didn’t know any Python whatsoever prior to this course, so in the beginning, it felt like being thrown into the sea without a life jacket. Petr is not a lifeguard; he is a swimming coach. He won’t rescue you—that’s too easy—but he will throw you a rope. (In fact, many ropes. You ask one question and he gives you five answers.) I appreciated that everyone was able to swim at their own pace. An experienced designer and astonishingly deep thinker, Petr offers far more than just coding knowledge. It was a privilege to be able to learn from him.


Again, thank you so much! I learned a ton these four weeks and I'm so grateful.

See you next week. :)

Keep warm,
June

Dear Petr and Claudia,

Thank you again for a wonderful course. I really made a leap in my python / scripting skills but more importantly I was happy to be given a platform to engage in critical dialogues regarding variable fonts, scripting or the future of inDesign/graphic design. It was a pleasure spending quality time and receiving mentorship from such great thinkers and designers such as yourselves.

Some feedback about the class as promised—mostly logistics as the course is very much self driven: I think the "curriculum" is perfectly balanced. I would have loved to go deeper in variable fonts or the implementation of it in PageBot, but there is never enough time for everything. I can see how a larger class population might not work as well as our 3-4 people course. Also the time scheduling worked perfectly for us, but I can see that if there were more people involved from different time zones, it would be hard especially for working professionals. We were lucky to be given the chance to dedicate most of our working hours for this class. We were able to put a lot of hours into coding. I can see this becoming a problem for students who does not have this luxury, I think this will be the biggest challenge for the course moving forward. To get similar results, it requires students to put in so much time.

I also extremely appreciate your flexibility and availability and responsiveness throughout the month.

Thank you and looking forward to seeing you very soon at the Hague!

Below is a testimonial, you are welcomed to use parts or the entire paragraph.

Testimonial ——
The one month course is designed to accommodate type designers with various levels of python and programming knowledge. The learning environment is set up similarly to a master's class which allows for Petr to focus on individual's needs. In addition, the course allows students to take their studies towards their personal needs and interests. The class is not just a skill learning environment as a good portion of the time is dedicated for critical discussions such as designing one's design process or the ways new technologies and developments will effect and change how we design and think about type.

Hi Petr, how are you?

First of all, I would like to thank you for the course. It was a fantastic time, and I have learned a lot! I’ve written a small testimonial below as you asked. Please, feel free to do whatever you want with it:

“For me, the Python scripting for type designers course from Design Design Space was a perfect complement to my formation as a typeface designer. It was a unique opportunity to learn type-related Python in first hand from a competent instructor. Petr doesn’t leave questions open, and the course’s pace flows according to each student’s needs. “ – Filipe Negrão

Secondly, I want to ask you about the “Live coaching of your (type)design project” that is described in DDS website. As you might know, I came from a graphic design background and last year I went to type@cooper to learn how to design typefaces properly, but I feel that I need to improve my skills to be able to release my first typeface in a high-quality standard. My first idea was to find some kind of internship but, besides Dalton Maag, our Foundries here in Brazil are all really small and independent. So, I think that being coached by you would be perfect for my development as a type designer. Do you think it is possible to have something like once or twice a month meetups to do that?

One last thing... I've just created one list of Brazilian Portuguese hyphenated words that could be useful for Pagebot. All the words were checked and revised with Python using web scraping in an open Portuguese dictionary (Michaelis). If you do think it is useful, please let me know the best way to send the file to you. Should I open a pull request on GitHub? Sorry if it's a dumb question, but I've never contributed to a project on Git before.

Best,
Filipe
