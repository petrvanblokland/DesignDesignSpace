Disassemble your graphic design into basic parameters. Why do you choose a color or a typeface? What other options do you have, other than choosing a color by number? How to define the visual grammar of a corporate identity?

In this workshop Jacques Bertin’s model of seven visual parameters (**color, contrast, texture, angle, position, size and shape**) is used as starting point for a number of exercises.

#### Example exercises

* Design simple pages to examine the relation between the seven parameters, such as color, contrast and size.
* Make gray scales and color circles, using paint and digital tools; 
* Understand the difference between additive and subtractive colors;
* Make the darkest black on Earth.

This workshop is followed up by [Visual grammar #2](#VG2).
