<p>The world has suddenly changed. Teaching in class rooms is no longer possible. As experienced as you are, educating designers, new skills are required for online teaching. </p>
<p>This workshop shares our experience of teaching online with DesignDesign.Space workshops for over 4 years now. And also, we love to show how we organized the latest online conference <a href="https://2020.typographics.com/typelab/">TypeLab 2020</a>, in collaboration with <a href="http://coopertype.org">Type Cooper</a> and <a href="https://2020.typographics.com">Typographics</a>.</p>
<h4>Example exercises</h4>
<ul>
<li>Learn to write exercises that can be done through digital media;</li>
<li>Develop methods for feedback, evaluation and validation of student work;</li>
<li>An introduction on simulation games, that can be played by students in an online environment.</li>
</ul>
<p>This workshop is followed up by <a href="#DE2">Teaching simulations and design games</a>.</p>
