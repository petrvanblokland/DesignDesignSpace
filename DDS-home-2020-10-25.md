## Coding simple scripted tools

### Automate repeating tasks in the design process

#### Start October 19<span class="sup">th</span> 2020 • 2 weeks • €290

~~~
box = box.newInfo()
~~~

After finishing [Basic coding in Python #1](#coding-in-python1), you are equipped with the basic coding skill to automate certain tasks that sometimes make a design process boring and lengthy.

The workshop is focused on very short scripts, only a couple of lines long, that automate repeating tasks in the design process. The result is a set of example scripts that can later be modified to be used in real life projects.

You can make a selection from the following exercises. And it is also possible to bring your own ideas.

#### Example exercises

* Make a script that runs through folders with images and applies Photoshop-like filters on each of them;
* Make a script that draws graphs based on information from a spreadsheet. Save the pages in PDF documents, using your own layout;
* Make a script that generates a simple website, based on content in a Markdown file.
* Make a script that checks a font for mistakes in spacing and kerning;
* Make a script that generates TTF and OTF fonts, after doing some automated operations on the outlines.

The use of <a href="http://drawbot.com" target="external">DrawBot</a> in this workshop requires a MacOS computer.

Completion of workshops [Basic coding in Python #1](#coding-in-python1) and [Basic coding in Python #1](#coding-in-python2) is recommended.

~~~
box = box.newInfo()
~~~

The focus of this workshop is on how to program user interaction. Extract the various options into menus, popups and checkboxes.

You can select several from the following exercises. And it is also possible to bring your own ideas.

#### Example exercises

* Make an interface that allows users to choose from the available image filters, before it runs through the entire set of image files.
* Make an interface that helps to choose from templates of graphs;
* Make an interface that shows the available color themes, before generating a website;
* Make an interface to show the various testing schemes on a font.

## General sketching techniques

### Learn the basic skills to visualise your ideas

#### Start November 16<span class="sup">th</span> 2020 • 2 weeks • €290

~~~
box = box.newInfo()
~~~

Sketching is the basis of every design process. Scribble early ideas to communicate with yourself and others. It is the ideal method for rapid prototyping, without spending much time on presentations. 

The workshop gives insight in various sketching techniques, using pen on paper as well as digital tools.

#### Example exercises

* Sketch the pages of some future publications;
* Sketch typefaces, using TypeCooker recipes;
* Sketch a series of info-graphics, visualizing narrative and data;
* Sketch abstract processes, such as a website design.

## Basic coding in Python #1

### Design by parameters

#### Start November 16<span class="sup">th</span> 2020 • 2 weeks • €290

~~~
box = box.newInfo()
~~~

Take one of your designs and try to find the rules that are behind the composition. Learn to express that information in Python code. Then discover how the program can generate alternative versions of your original design, by the use of color themes, different page sizes and other parameters.

The workshop assumes no prior knowledge of programming. Existing Open Source libraries are used, such as DrawBot and PageBotNano. Exercises take you step by step through the process of coding your graphic design.

#### Example exercises 

* Select a publication and analyze the (typographic) proportions that it contains. 
* Find out how these measures relate to each other.
* Sketch the relations between the extracted values, e.g. what are the possibilities for various page sizes?
* Learn the basics of generating pages by code.
* Automate the generation of equivalent color themes and alternative layouts.

The use of <a href="http://drawbot.com" target="external">DrawBot</a> in this workshop requires a MacOS computer.

This workshop is followed up by [Basic coding in Python #2](#coding-in-python2).

~~~

After finishing [Basic coding in Python #1](#coding-in-python1), you have made a program that is doing one specific task. Great as that may be, it is hard to reuse that code for other projects. How nice would it be, to create a **“library”** with knowledge, that can be called for similar designs, without writing everything from scratch again?

The focus of this workshop is in making code more sustainable, using **functions, methods and classes**. Existing Open Source libraries are used, such as **DrawBot** and **PageBotNano**. Exercises take you step by step through the process of coding your graphic design. Instead of manually building a metaforical car, it may be more profitable to build a factory for cars. 

#### Example exercises

* Make a selection of different publications and analyze the variety of (typographic) proportions that they share;
* Sketch the relations between the extracted values and write them as coded rules;
* Store these rules as a library of Python classes;
* Learn to use this library in future design projects.

The use of <a href="http://drawbot.com" target="external">DrawBot</a> in this workshop requires a MacOS computer.

Completion of workshop [Basic coding in Python #1](#coding-in-python1) is recommended.

## Running a studio #1

### Experience the making of moodboards and presentations

#### Start November 30<span class="sup">th</span> 2020 • 2 weeks • €290

~~~
box = box.newInfo()
~~~

Adding the process of sketching, presentation techniques help to get ideas come across. Convince yourself and others about the values of your design. Making moodboards and presentations is just another form of rapid prototyping.

The workshop gives an overview of making a presentation, using materials, 3D and digital tools.

#### Example exercises

* Choose a topic or select one of your former projects. Visualize the design decisions in 3 moodboards.
* Sketch presentations in a small scale. What do you want to show in such a storyboard?
* Present an existing design project in no more than 5 slides. Pay attention to consistency of layout, typegraphy and the use of color.
* Can you present what makes your design so unique?

### The making of quotes, briefings, plannings and requirement lists

#### Start December 14<span class="sup">th</span> 2020 • 2 weeks • €290

~~~
box = box.newInfo()
~~~

Doing administration work is often seen as a boring by-product of running a studio. Planning projects is vital, but is often ignored. Learn to look at these processes as if they were regular design jobs. Doing them can be fun. And they can even become one of your products. 

The workshop shows methods to design the process of administration, as if it was an interesting graphic design project.

#### Example exercises

* Design templates for quotes and invoices, using spreadsheet applications and Google Docs.
* Learn to distinguish between the “go” and “no-go” requirements of a design;
* Sketch info-graphics that show the iterations of a design process. Visualise the planning for your customer;
* Automate the generation of progress reports.

The world has suddenly changed. Teaching in class rooms is no longer possible. As experienced as you are, educating designers, the new skills are required for online teaching. 

This workshop shares our experience of teaching online with DesignDesign.Space workshops for 4 years now. And also, we love to show how we organized the latest TypeLab.

#### Example exercises

* Learn to write exercises that can be done through digital media;
* Develop methods for feedback, evaluation and validation of student work;
* An introduction on simulation games, that can be played with students in an online environment.

## Version management

### Using Githib, consistency testing and the creation of automated manuals

#### Undated • 2 weeks • €290

~~~
box = box.newInfo()
~~~

After finishing [Coding simple scripted tools](#coding-simple-scripted-tools), it is time to concentrate more on the user interface. If scripts are used by other designers than yourself, it is more user-friendly to offer a window with checkboxes and buttons, than altering the options directly in the code.

Once a project grows larger, it may become necessary to get other developers involved. This workshop addresses the use of Github for version management. 

* Set up your existing (type design) projects as a Github repository, so you can share changes and updates with the other designers, who work on the same project;
* Add tests inside your sources to ensure the validity of the code;
* Write scripts that generate automated manuals from the projects that you made.

The use of <a href="http://drawbot.com" target="external">DrawBot</a> in this workshop requires a MacOS computer.

Completion of workshop [Coding simple scripted tools](#simple-scripted-tools) is recommended.

## Basic principles of type design

### For graphic designers: how to select a typeface. Understanding contrast by writing. Experiment with weight and width variations.

#### Start January 18<span class="sup">th</span> 2021 • 2 weeks • €290

~~~
box = box.newInfo()
~~~

Graphic designers work with type all day. It is one of their most important tools. Yet, it may not be obvious to select an appreciate the differences between existing typefaces. Which one to select for a certain task? Which type works best in logos? How to write a brief that communcates with typographers and type designers?

#### Example exercises

* Write alphabets with a broad nib pencil to experience the construction of **“translation”** contrast;
* Write with sharp pencils to experience the construction of **“expansion”** contrast;
* Learn the behaviour of glyph shapes, varying weight and width 
* Study variantions by <a href="http://www.typecooker.com" target="external">Type Cooker</a>;

The design of visual identities is often confused with the drawing a logo. What more is needed to create a visual grammar that people will recognize? What are the parameters that lead to remembering a name or a brand? 

This workshop shows different types of processes to design a logo. Match the list of requirements with the intended function. Various methods for sketching, design, testing and feedback are topic of the two weeks. Also it is part of the exercises to see how  different techniques and medium influence the shape and meaning of logos.

#### Example exercises

* Learn about sketching techniques, in combination with methods of feedback. How to test different versions?
* Practice some essentials of type design;
* Study the effects of size and resolution on logos;
* How to extract the visual grammar of a logo, to be applied separately in publications and manuals.

This workshop offers two weeks of writing scripts that support your type design process. Many time consuming tasks can be automated. Even a script of 10 lines, that costs 2 days to script is profitable if it saves 2 weeks of repeatative work.

#### Example exercises

* Learn to use the supplied example scripts;
* Analyse your current way of working. Which parts of that could be automated?
* Write some scripts for those tasks by adapting the example scripts;
* Learn to generalize code to be useful for future projects.

### Using the seven parameters of Bertin: position, size, shape, texture, value, orientation and color.

#### Start April 26<span class="sup">th</span> 2021 • 2 weeks • €290

~~~
#box = box.newInfo()
~~~

Disassemble your graphic design into basic parameters. Why do you choose a color or a typeface? What other options do you have, other than choosing a color by number? How to define the visual grammar of a corporate identity?

In this workshop Jacques Bertin’s model of seven visual parameters (**color, contrast, texture, angle, position, size and shape**) is used as starting point for a number of exercises.

#### Example exercises

* Design simple pages to examine the relation between the seven parameters, such as color, contrast and size.
* Make gray scales and color circles, using paint and digital tools; 
* Understand the difference between additive and subtractive colors;
* Make the darkest black on Earth.
