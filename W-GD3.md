What seems to be an infinite amount of availabe typefaces, once examined on their features and implementation, the choice may be rather limited. What are those criteria to select a typeface, besides if you like their style and atmosphere?

#### Example exercises

* Learn to categorize the typefaces that are available on your computer.
* Open the fonts to find their hidden treasures and problems;
* Write simple code to produce specimens that test the various characteristics of those typefaces.
