# What is your design space?

Tell us want you want. Improve your non-existing coding skills? Train your self-discipline? Seeking a sparring partner for an interesting new design project? Or you simply need a refreshing break from a “boring” design practice. 

The teachers at **DesignDesign.Space** ask the toughest questions. If you are happy with your design, what exactly is it, that you are happy with?

Even the path of finding your most interesting topic could be a design process in itself. How to start? How to continue? And most important: how to finish successfully within the given amount of time? 

## How studies work

* During a free initial hangout, you describe what you want to achieve.
* Together we will find a way for you doing that. Topics. Teachers. Targets.
* In sequences of relative short assignments, online hangouts, feedback and reflections, we guide you through your study project. And more important, we’ll teach you how to do that yourself.
* It can be a day. Or a week. A month. Or a year. Whatever fits your goals and available time.

## Testimonials

*“This was a unique opportunity in that it wasn’t just a programming class but one that was specifically catered to type designers to meet their needs. I didn’t know any Python whatsoever prior to this course, so in the beginning, it felt like being thrown into the sea without a life jacket. Petr is not a lifeguard; he is a swimming coach. He won’t rescue you—that’s too easy—but he will throw you a rope. (In fact, many ropes. You ask one question and he gives you five answers.) I appreciated that everyone was able to swim at their own pace. An experienced designer and astonishingly deep thinker, Petr offers far more than just coding knowledge. It was a privilege to be able to learn from him.*
*Again, thank you so much! I learned a ton these four weeks and I'm so grateful.”* **– June Shin**

---

*“The one month course is designed to accommodate type designers with various levels of python and programming knowledge. The learning environment is set up similarly to a master's class which allows for Petr to focus on individual's needs. In addition, the course allows students to take their studies towards their personal needs and interests. The class is not just a skill learning environment as a good portion of the time is dedicated for critical discussions such as designing one's design process or the ways new technologies and developments will effect and change how we design and think about type.”* **– Cem Eskinazi**

---

*“For me, the Python scripting for type designers course from Design Design Space was a perfect complement to my formation as a typeface designer. It was a unique opportunity to learn type-related Python in first hand from a competent instructor. Petr doesn’t leave questions open, and the course’s pace flows according to each student’s needs.”* **– Filipe Negrão**

## A 5-day workshop about Graphic Design^780

The workshop addresses the profession of Graphic Design. What skills and knowledge should students get to be a designer for the rest of their professional lives? 

How would you design such a workshop for yourself? How would you train that design skill?

DesignDesign.Space can coach you in that process. [More...](scales-more-780.html)

# DesignDesign.Scales

The DesignDesign.Space started a new initiative. Under the name DesignDesign.Scales, a growing series of small design assignment is available, together with hints about their process and criteria. 

Some will be published as a single Tweet or an Instagram post, referring to the page with additional background information.

Scales are like exercises in music. You can’t play enough of them. Yet, a symphony needs more than just scales. Searching is learning. Playing is exploring.

If you don't manage to finalize an assignment in the recommended amount of time, then that is not a problem. Designing the process and planning is an integral part of the design process itself. 

Maybe next time you can better select the level of details (select the level of details better). Or pick a different tool. Or another “quality level” for your sketches.

Each assignment has its own number. You can get an impression about their topics by their range of 100. Within that range, simple assignments have low numbers. High numbers indicate higher complexity. 

Note that most assignments in a topic relate to other topics as well.

Some assignments are grouped as a sequence. Their number is followed by a letter.
