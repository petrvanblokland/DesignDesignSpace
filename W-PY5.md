This workshop offers two weeks of writing scripts that support your type design process. Many time consuming tasks can be automated. Even a script of 10 lines, that costs 2 days to script is profitable if it saves 2 weeks of repeatative work.

#### Example exercises

* Learn to use the supplied example scripts;
* Analyse your current way of working. Which parts of that could be automated?
* Write some scripts for those tasks by adapting the example scripts;
* Learn to generalize code to be useful for future projects.
