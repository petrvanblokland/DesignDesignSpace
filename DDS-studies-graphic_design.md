## Scripting of online publication design
 
Design systems that generate applications, documents and websites, intended for online usage. How to bridge the gap between unpredictable content, sketching design rules, the design of templates that use high level typographic standards, scriptable illustration techniques and applications for automated output, using DrawBot and PageBot, generating HTML/CSS/Javascript (for OSX and Linux platforms).

Any design process benefits from short iterations in a team, automated prototyping and the merging of disciplines. Web design is not different.

Learn to use PageBot to script sites like this one.

## Identity design: Branding with and without the use of logos

Design parametric models for an identity. Which parameters create the visual coherency? Which parameters are diverse, without the need to specify? Is that always the same list? If not, what is the best selection for a particular brand?
How to write scripts to automate (parts of) the models for your parameters testing.

What is the best usage of graphic elements in a brand? Which are used for recognition and coherency? And which are undefined on purpose, supporting the visual diversity of publications?
