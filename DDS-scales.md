## Excercise by yourself.
## Or use DesignDesign.Space as your coach.

Many of our exercises become published online, named **Scales**. Because that is what they are: the scales that musicians play for practice. The name also refers to scaled models that architects use to visualize their ideas. The scaling of details is an important part of any design process.

The growing number of exercises on this site contain a short description of the challenge, paired with **“how-to-do-it”** information. Try them. If it works for you, that is great. If you need more coaching, then consider a study at DesignDesign.Space, where many more of these exercises are waiting for you. Custom made.

If you run out of time when finalizing an exercise, that is never a problem. Designing the process and planning the flow are  integral parts of the design process itself. Maybe next time you choose a better level of detail. Or select another approach. Or pick a different tool.  

Exercises have their own unique number. You can get a hint about their topics from their 100-range. **Research** oriented exercises are numbered from 200-299. Typography from 1100-1199. Within that range, simple assignments have low numbers. Higher numbers indicate more complexity. 

Some Exercises are grouped as a sequence. Their numbers are followed by a letter to show the order.
