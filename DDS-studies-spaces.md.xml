<h2>Choosing colors</h2>
<p>How to select a color or a color palette? What criteria matter in a given set of circumstances? How does material, medium and technique influence such a choice?<br />
In a sequence of exercises, the student will develop ways to look, measure and compare selected colors. </p>

<h2>Creating an identity: the look and feel</h2>
<p>Learn how to design a series of visual components for an identity, so the identity gains a strong character. Designing the balance between coherency and diversity with a set of recognizable elements which will represent the brand in an optimal form. <br />
Sketching, making models and making presentations in all different stages in the design process will be the main course of this program.</p>

<p><a name="design-patterns-and-structures"/></p>
<h2>Design patterns and structures</h2>
<p>Making one-off designs is relatively easy. There are no other requirement than for that single solution. If at all. Learn to design methods and strategies if the plan changes along the way. How to proceed if a single design needs to become a series? How to respond to clients that change their goals in that direction?</p>

<h2>How to organize structure in chaos</h2>
<p>You have a project that starts with a pile of legacy publications. Or the content of an attic. Or you inherited and archive of design stuff that is supposed to become a website. Where do you start? How do you make such a project finish in the time that is available? Learn the development of selection methods, sketching techniques and directions to validate the process itself. </p>

<h2>Design a workspace</h2>
<p>Design the interior of a workspace, based on requirements, planning, budget and usage. What are the most important requirements and attributes? Development of sketching techniques, modelling and presentation. Design the process itself, alongside the interior. Special focus on materials, color, textures and the usage of space. The interior could be your own studio space, as well as the target of an external design project.</p>

<h2>Design the environment</h2>
<p>Whatever your environment is - physical, virtual and mental - that brings your creative thinking to the next level, you can make it help focus for development and improvement.</p>
<p>Through a variety of exercises – writing, sketching, making an inventory of environmental aspects and talking with others – you'll experience new opportunities to get more grip on your environment.  </p>
