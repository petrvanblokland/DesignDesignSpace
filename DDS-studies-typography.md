## Learn how to use TYPETR typefaces in your designs

While designing the typefaces for the TYPETR library, we obviously have ideas, hints and tips how they can best be used in typography. And while producing them, many examples and type specimens are made for testing and presentation. Why not share these with people who take the effort to buy a full family license?

See the TYPETR websites featuring [Upgrade](http://upgrade.typenetwork.com) (all type used in this website) and [Bitcount](http://bitcount.typenetwork.com) as examples of what we could talk about.
