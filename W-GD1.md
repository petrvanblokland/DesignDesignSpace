This workshop offers two weeks of analysing typography and layouts in existing publications. Then take the resulting rules into possible variations. Study the basics of responsive layouts and generative design. What makes good typography? What is the influence of various media on text?

#### Example exercises

* Collect representative publications and analyse the structure of their content and measurements;
* Define rules and visual dependencies;
* Design variations, e.g. what happens if the page size changes?
* Learn the behaviour of grids in relation to typography.

Completion of workshops [Basic coding in Python #1](#PY1), [Basic coding in Python #1](#PY2) and [Coding simple scripted tools](#PY3) is recommended but not required.
