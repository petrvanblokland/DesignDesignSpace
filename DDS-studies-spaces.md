## Design patterns and structures

Making one-off designs is relatively easy. There are no other requirement than for that single solution. If at all. Learn to design methods and strategies if the plan changes along the way. How to proceed if a single design needs to become a series? How to respond to clients that change their goals in that direction?

## How to organize structure in chaos

You have a project that starts with a pile of legacy publications. Or the content of an attic. Or you inherited and archive of design stuff that is supposed to become a website. Where do you start? How do you make such a project finish in the time that is available? Learn the development of selection methods, sketching techniques and directions to validate the process itself.

## Design the environment

Whatever your environment is - physical, virtual and mental - that brings your creative thinking to the next level, you can make it help focus for development and improvement.

Through a variety of exercises – writing, sketching, making an inventory of environmental aspects and talking with others – you'll experience new opportunities to get more grip on your environment.
