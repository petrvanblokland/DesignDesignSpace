<h3>Example studies</h3>
<h2>Develop your process. Expand your skills.</h2>
<p>Design studies come in many different forms. There is never a single solution. It is one of the main tasks of every designer: to search and select. Which type of study fits you best? What kind of topic, medium or intensity appeals best to your way of learning? Let us know, we might have some challenging exercises for you.</p>

<h2>It all happens in DesignDesign.Space studies</h2>
<p>If you tell us what you want to study by mail or in a first free online hangout, we are happy to make suggestions. What would you like to achieve? Seeking a sparring partner for an interesting new design project? Improving your latent skills, while training your self-discipline? Or simply needing a refreshing break from your normal design practice? </p>
<hr />
<h2>DesignDesign.Space as your coach</h2>
<p><strong>DesignDesign.Space</strong> can help you to answer these questions and to achieve your goals. Coaching you through your study, the teachers can ask the toughest questions. They are also available to help you answering them: If you are happy with the design you have finished, what exactly are you happy with? How does that fit the expectations of the user? And how would you get there next time?</p>
<hr />
<h2>What is your design space?</h2>
<p><strong>DesignDesign.Space</strong> offers a wide variety of study topics: ranging from graphic design to type design, typography, programming, identities, 3D and education.</p>
<hr />
<h2>How studies work</h2>
<ul>
<li>In a first free hangout, we will talk about what you want to achieve.</li>
<li>Together, we will find a way for you to get there. Topics &amp; Tools. By painting, drawing, sketching or by coding. Or by a combination of all.</li>
<li>In sequences of relative short assignments, online hangouts, personal feedback and reflections, we explore the paths of your study project. And more importantly, we’ll teach you how to do that yourself.</li>
<li>The journey can take a day. Or a week. A month. A year. Whichever fits your goals, time and resources. We see it as our challenge to customize the study to what is realistic for you. And to make it match the result you may need in your daily practice.</li>
<li>As your plans are likely to change along the way, the changes in your study time can always be discussed.</li>

For us, educating other designers is as much of a challenge as any design process. <a href="mailto:info@designdesign.space?subject=What%20I%20would%20like%20to%20%20study%20in%20DesignDesign.Space...">Send</a> us your request for topics that we never thought about. Or ideas about how this website can be improved. Lure us into teaching you in a different way than what we suggest here. We’ll likely take the challenge.</p>

<h1>Studies in 2019</h1>
<p>We keep improving the curriculum. The mandatory design of design education. Instead of the fixed <a href="2018-program.html">2018</a> list of workshops, studies and dates, in practice, we found out that it is better to make the schedule entirely flexible. Hints of topics, templates of studies and suggestions for the process behind.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Pricing</h2>
<p>Each lesson is an online hangout, lasting for a part of the day, morning or afternoon, depending on your timezone. The pricing is based on the length and intensity of a study. </p>
<p>If a study is spread over a longer period time, intensity can be lower for the same price. However, such a schema requires more self-discipline from students to take full advantage of their study and the support we can offer them.</p>

<h2>Live coaching of your (type) design project</h2>
<p>You have a challenging complex design project to work on. It is really interesting and rewarding, but it is also hard to get it planning and keep quality under control. Especially if the project runs over a longer period of time.<br />
How the coaching is organized, depends on what you need, what works best. It can be a single lesson for support, during the initial stages of the project, or it can extend to helping you with management and feedback of the entire project. </p>
<p>Part of the coaching role can also be the development of simple scripted tools to support the design process. </p>

<h2>Discover the basics of type design</h2>
<p>Type design is not your main background, but as a designer, you often are in situation when it would be good knowing more about it. When selecting a typeface for one of your designs. Or when you need to explain it to your client. It is possible to read about it. But it’s a lot more efficient learning how to write and draw by yourself.</p>

<h2>Virtual studies and teaching online</h2>
<p>With a total of 60 years of educating design, both in physical space, as well as in virtual environments, we can offer that experience as a topic of a study. How to design the way that you teach? How to develop methods for feedback? What works in an online environment and what doesn’t? How to build layers of assignments? What is its goal? What is realistic to expect?</p>

<h2>Virtual sabbatical</h2>
<p>You have been working as a designer for some years, employed by a studio or running your own. You have been really successful or a bit less, in any case, there is a moment in time to answer the question “What’s next?”. </p>
<p>At the same time, you don’t think you have the age or freedom or financial resources to take a real sabbatical break and do a Master study abroad for 2 years. DesignDesign.Space offers the opportunity of doing a virtual sabbatical: studying new topics or deepen the ones that you already know in a challenging online environment, together with other students, who are seeking similar extensions to their professional career. How this is organized, depends on your needs and resources. </p>

<h1>What students wrote</h1>
<pre><code>box = section.newMain()
</code></pre>

<p><em>“This was a unique opportunity in that it wasn’t just a programming class, but one that was specifically catered to type designers to meet their needs. I didn’t know any Python whatsoever prior to this course, so in the beginning, it felt like being thrown into the sea without a life jacket. Petr is not a lifeguard; he is a swimming coach. He won’t rescue you — that’s too easy — but he will throw you a rope. (In fact, many ropes. You ask one question and he gives you five answers.) I appreciated that everyone was able to swim at their own pace. An experienced designer and astonishingly deep thinker, Petr offers far more than just coding knowledge. It was a privilege to be able to learn from him.</em><br />
<em>Again, thank you so much! I learned a ton these four weeks and I'm so grateful.”</em> <strong>– June Shin</strong></p>
<hr />
<p><em>“The one month course is designed to accommodate type designers with various levels of Python and programming knowledge. The learning environment is set up similarly to a master's class which allows Petr to focus on individual needs. In addition, the course allows students to take their studies towards their personal needs and interests. The class is not just a skill learning environment as a good portion of the time is dedicated to critical discussions, such as designing one's design process or the ways new technologies and developments will effect and change how we design and think about type.”</em> <strong>– Cem Eskinazi</strong></p>
<hr />
<p><em>“For me, the Python scripting for type designers course from Design Design Space was a perfect complement to my formation as a typeface designer. It was a unique opportunity to learn type-related Python in first hand from a competent instructor. Petr doesn’t leave questions open, and the course’s pace flows according to each student’s needs.”</em> <strong>– Filipe Negrão</strong></p>
<hr />
<p><em>“This is my first time to have a formal Latin Design class. I am very lucky that I can learn from Petr because there are only a few Latin design classes in Taiwan.</em> <br />
<em>Petr is always teaching design knowledge enthusiastically, using all he knows, when you have questions. Petr not only taught us how to design Latin fonts, but also how to think about the effect of every design and how to adjust them to become a better one. The most important thing is that you don't have to be afraid, if you are a starter because Petr will give a tailored class for everyone. I can promise that you can get a lot of treasures from Petr. I appreciate a lot that I could gain this experience from DDS.”</em> <strong>- Tom Kuo</strong></p>
<hr />
<p><em>“The aspect that fascinated me most about this program was the idea of building your own design tools to address design issues/problems. Although coding and programming was something I was always curious about, it was something I imagined to be a very separate and ‘complicated’ activity from my own. But the experience with Petr made me even more curious and eager to learn further. This was a very important foundation for me not only to further learning and integrating programming/coding into my design activities but also and more importantly rethink about my own design approach in a very fundamental way.</em><br />
<em>Thank you so much, Petr, for this amazing experience and I look forward to interacting further”.</em> <strong>– Andy Naorem</strong></p>

<h1>The prices of DDS-studies are based on individual coaching and custom made design challenges with personal feedback. That is different from standard online courses.</h1>
<pre><code>box = section.newMain()
</code></pre>

<h2>Pricing</h2>
<p>Each lesson is an online hangout, lasting for part of the day, morning or afternoon, depending on your timezone. The total price is based on the length and intensity of your study. </p>
<p>If a study is spread over a longer period of time, intensity can be lower for the same price. However, it requires more self-discipline for a student to take full advantage of the study and the support that we can offer.</p>
<p>The prices of the studies are indicators: a specific topic can be addressed in a couple of days. Or it can be the subject of a thourough study, taking a month or longer to finish.</p>
<p>Lessons can extend in time, if multiple students attend at the same time.</p>
<p>Note that pricing changed to Euro's.</p>
<ul>
<li>Initial online hangout, free of charge.</li>
<li>A single lesson, full of exercises for a whole day: <strong>€170</strong> per student</li>
<li>A week of exercises and 3 lessons: <strong>€450</strong> per student</li>
