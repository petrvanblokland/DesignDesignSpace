Graphic designers work with type all day. It is one of their most important tools. Yet, it may not be obvious to select and appreciate the differences between existing typefaces. Which one to select for a certain task? Which type works best in logos? How to write a brief that communcates with typographers and type designers?

#### Example exercises

* Write alphabets with a broad nib pencil to experience the construction of **“translation”** contrast;
* Write with sharp pencils to experience the construction of **“expansion”** contrast;
* Learn the behaviour of glyph shapes, varying weight and width

* Digitize your writings into outlines, using your favourite type editor;
